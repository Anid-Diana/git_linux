# Git and GitHub
I had never worked with Git before, so the information presented in the training materials was new to me. There were almost no difficulties with the passage of the material.
1. Listened to weeks 1 and 2 of the course [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github)

> I really liked the course. For a beginner, the information is presented and explained very well. You can repeat everything according to the video, and it helps to remember the material better. 
2. Completed levels [learngitbranching.js.org:](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk)
